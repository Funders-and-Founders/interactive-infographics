<p>When you throw together two ambitious people from different backgrounds and have them live and work in close quarters under the pressure of having little money and the constant fear of the startup failing - conflicts are bound to happen. Married couples argue 321 times a year. Although there is no statistics about co-founder fighting - the number is probably not too far.</p>
<p>The fist in avoid these conflicts is avoid faux-cofounders. Who are these people?</p>
<h3>Types of Partners</h3>
First of all, choose the right person. Just like in dating, take your time to find the right person. There are plenty of wrong choices out there. Here are the steriotypical profiles you need to avoid.

<strong>The Lawyer.</strong> This type of co-founder tries to define every expection you can define. He will try to put everything into an agreement. The downside of this tye of co-founder is that he will worry about dividing things up before actually creating anything. What is the point of having all the eauity split agreements if there is really nothing to devide in the beginning.
<strong>The Friend.</strong> This type of co-founder is probably someone you knew before working on your startup together. They are probably a really nice person that got excited about the startup and said that loved the idea. 6 months later, after the honeymoon period of the statup was up, they lost steam and stopped working as hard. At the same time they are thingking they have 50% of the equity.
<strong>The Genius.</strong> This type of co-founder is probably really smart. Much smarter than you. They work hard. You probably firth fell in love with that combination. But they are so brilliant they don't even need you. They just cannot collaborate with anyone. In effect you are not working together - what is the point of having this co-founder then?
<strong>The Marketeer</strong>. This type co-founder hustles day and night getting clients and marketing. That is great, except for they have no understing of the product that the othe co-founder is building. When the technical co-founder tries to explain to them why the javascript is slowing down the load time they draw a black. Run the other way.
<strong>The Thinker.</strong>This type of cofounder is going to want to strategize with you a lot. They are going to have grandios plans of revolutionizing the industry, but no real clue of how to get the initial 1000 users. It's all just talk, no action. Send them back to the academia.
<strong>The Lurker.</strong> This type co-founder always has the Job Monster open in a tab. They have multiple Facebook accounts, that they use to market their many side projects. Their official Facebook account doesn't say anything about them doing a startup. At any moment and without warning they will up and go work on something else.

<h3>Types of Conflicts</h3>

Ok, now that you found the right person - you are still going to have conflicts. Whether those conflicts are going to destroy your startup depends on how you deal with them. Now let's look at the most common conflict and what to do about them:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
        <strong>My idea is better!</strong>
        Ideas are worthless. Execution is everything. Stop fighting about this. Try executing a bad idea - you wil see that you got a lot farther than you'd think.
    </li>
	<li><strong>Who gets to decide what?</strong> Devide up the responsibilities. Let you co-founder decide - it's healthy for you to delegate responsibility. Otherwise you are going to burn out before you know it.</li>    
	<li>
        <strong>I work harder than you</strong>Unless there is a pattern of your co-founder working less than you - calm down. Doing exactly 50% at all times is pretty hard - and it's hard to measure. Manybe they failed to make a sale in a week, but next week they are going to bring in the biggest customer.
    </li>
	<li><strong>Leave, or I leave!</strong>
        This one is the worst. The worst thing is not even that one of you is going to leave but that you have probably been fighting for a while before the situation got this ugly. If you care about whether this startup survives at all, solve this asap.
    </li>
	<li><strong>OMG, We are gonna failâ€¦</strong>
        Almost every day in a startup can be the last one. Failure is always in the back of everyone mind anyway. So why talk about it? If they are talking about it - stop them. Your enthusiam is your biggest asset. so don't let you co-founder chissel it away.
    </li>
	<li><strong>Who gets what</strong>
        Equity vesting agreements will solve a lot of the fighting about dividing up equity. If you are just starting out, divide the equity 50/50. There is no reason to give to to the person who had the idea first. What's the worth of an idea?
    </li>
	<li><strong>Who cleans up the pizza?</strong>
        This is petty. It really should never happen. But co-founders argue over this one two. Over time it builds up. Get a cleaning person. What ever it takes to focus. Or just clean the pizza.
    </li>
	<li><strong>We need to strategize more</strong>
        "Nine times out of ten strategizing is just a form of procastination." <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html" title="Startup = Growth">Paul Graham.</a>. Better to do the wrong thing, than do nothing.
    </li>
	<li>
        <strong>I'm out at 5 pm</strong>
        If they have a life outsie the startup, let them know that you need 100% of their time.
    </li>
</ul>
